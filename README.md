# sdfat-spin
------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 implementation of the FAT filesystem on SD.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* Open file by name or dirent number
* Find free cluster, allocate a cluster
* Read currently opened file's attributes: file name and extension, is directory, is the volume name, size
* Read, write a block of data

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library

~~P2/SPIN2:~~
* ~~p2-spin-standard-library~~

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (bytecode): OK, tested with 5.9.10-beta
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.10-beta
* P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (nu-code): Untested
* P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.10-beta
* P1/SPIN1 OpenSpin (bytecode): Untested (deprecated)
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build
* TBD
